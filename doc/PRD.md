# RC Car Racing Game - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### Vision
A simple, engaging web-based RC car racing game with top-down perspective that prioritizes gameplay mechanics over visual fidelity. The game will demonstrate AI-assisted development capabilities while delivering fun racing experiences.

### Constraints
- Must be fully codeable by Claude Code
- All assets must be AI-generated
- Focus on gameplay over graphics/sound
- Web-based implementation

## 2. Visual Design Direction

### Art Style: Minimalist Flat Design
- **Philosophy**: Clean, modern aesthetic prioritizing clarity and performance
- **Color Approach**: Limited palette with high contrast for gameplay clarity
- **Shape Language**: Perfect geometry, clean lines, no textures or gradients
- **Performance Benefits**: Optimized for canvas rendering and AI asset generation

### Design Principles
- Functionality over decoration
- High contrast for accessibility
- Consistent geometric shapes
- Scalable vector-style graphics rendered as simple shapes

## 3. Core Gameplay

### Game Mode
- Single-player time trials
- Race against AI opponents (3-4 cars total)
- Lap-based racing (3 laps per race)

### Controls
- WASD or Arrow keys for direct movement control
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration with momentum
- Arcade-style handling prioritizing responsiveness
- Future enhancement: Realistic throttle/steering controls and tank controls

### Core Mechanics
- Speed management through turns
- Collision detection with track boundaries
- Position tracking and lap counting
- Time-based scoring system

## 3. Technical Specifications

### Platform
- HTML5 Canvas-based game
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)
- Custom lightweight game engine
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS on modern browsers
- Responsive loading experience
- Optimized file size

## 4. Game Features

### Track System
- 3 different geometric track layouts (oval, rectangle with chicanes, figure-8)
- Simple programmatic track generation
- Track elements: straight sections, 90-degree turns, basic curves
- Visual track boundaries and checkpoints
- Future enhancement: Organic curved circuits and procedural generation

### RC Car System
- 2 different car types with distinct characteristics:
  - Balanced racer (medium speed, medium handling)
  - Speed-focused car (higher top speed, more challenging handling)
- Future enhancement: Additional car types with specialized attributes

### AI Opponents
- Simple path-following AI with predetermined waypoints
- Speed variation to create competitive racing
- Basic collision avoidance
- Future enhancement: Reinforcement learning-based AI for advanced behaviors

### Progression System
- All content available from start
- Focus on personal best lap times
- Simple race completion tracking
- Future enhancement: Unlock system and rating mechanics

## 5. User Interface

### Main Menu
- Start Race
- Select Car
- Select Track
- Settings (sound toggle, controls)
- Instructions

### In-Game HUD
- Current lap (X/3)
- Race position (1st, 2nd, etc.)
- Lap timer
- Best lap time
- Mini-map (optional)

### Post-Race Screen
- Final position
- Best lap time
- Personal best notification (if achieved)
- Restart/Menu options

## 6. Asset Requirements (AI-Generated)

### Visual Assets
- 2 RC car sprites (minimalist flat design - simple colored rectangles with directional indicators)
- 3 basic track environments (clean outlined paths with solid background colors)
- UI elements (flat buttons, simple typography, monochromatic color schemes)
- Simple visual effects (basic geometric particles)
- Color palette: Clean whites, single accent colors, high contrast for readability
- Future enhancement: More detailed sprites and environments

### Audio Assets
- Not included in initial version
- Future consideration for enhanced user experience
